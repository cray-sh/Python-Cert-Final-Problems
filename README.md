# Python-Cert-Final-Problems
The capstone project for the automation with python certificate is 4 separate problems to tackle

Problem 1:
You have received a zip folder containing a number of images that the company wants to use for thumbnails
Unfortunately whoever gave you the data didn't realize it had to be in a certain format, cropped, and rotated correctly.
The goal for problem 1 is to create a program that takes photos out of one folder/directory, converts and formats them properly, and then saves
 in a secondary location for all final processed photos.
 
Problem 2:
Write a program/script that will convert a series of .txt files, which are customer reviews, into python dictionaires,
after which they will be uploaded to the website given (in django) to be seen. In other words,
input .txt reviews grab the info off of them and put them into a format that django will use to
upload to website.

Problem 3:

Problem Description:
Using a JSON file that includes sales data, fill in the script as needed so that it accomplishes the following:
    1. Which car model had the most sales
    (hint says call format_car method for this)
    
    2. Calculate the most popular car_year across all make/models.
    (i.e. find how many cars were sold in each year and out of those which was the most)

Using the conclusions found to 1 and 2, construct a PDF report that details this and send it to the given email/details

Problem 4:
This is a combination of everything learned so far, check the script for more info, its a big one,

Automate the resizing/formatting of photos, search through a variety of descriptions, use those two 
to post to a website, then summarize that info in a pdf, have that pdf sent via email, and finally
create a script to monitor the health of the system doing all of this to send an email if it's unhappy
